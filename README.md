# COVID-19-DESKTOP-NOTIFICATION-APPLICATION
An App to send Desktop Notifications regarding Daily COVID-19 new cases and new deaths

This Application works based on scraping, which involves the use of python libraries like BeautifulSoup for web scraping and ToastNotifier for creating a notifier

It scrapes the daily number of new covid cases from the government source and uses them along with the Request library and thus sends us the data in the form of a notifier.
